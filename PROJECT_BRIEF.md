# MCP Servers

This project will be my tool for managing my MCP tools written in go.

It will provide a single entrypoint MCP server that provides a number of different MCP tools in a modular way.

I want to be able to create new MCP tools and have the server automatically pick them up and make them available to MCP clients.
